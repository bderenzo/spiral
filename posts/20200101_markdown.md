# Markdown syntax 

## Summary

* [Emphasis](#emphasis)
* [Lists](#lists)
* [Code](#code)
* [Links](#links)
* [Images](#images)
* [Tables](#tables)

## Emphasis

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

## Lists

Here is a simple list:

* this one
* that one
* the other one

Here is a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

---

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients: 
   - carrots
   - celery
   - lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow  
   this algorithm:
   - find wooden spoon 
   - manage pot
      - uncover pot  
      - stir  
      - cover pot  
      - balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle  
   - wait 10 minutes 
   - goto first step (or shut off burner when done) 
   
* Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

## Code

Here's a code block sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

## Links

Here's a link to [a website](https://foo.bar). Here's a link to a [local
doc](local-doc.html).

## Images

Here is an image:

## Tables

Tables can look like this:

size | material     | color
---- | ------------ | ------------
9    | leather      | brown
10   | hemp canvas  | natural
11   | glass        | transparent

You can specify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines. 
A colon at the left of the separator line will make the column left-aligned; a 
colon on the right of the line will make the column right-aligned; colons at both 
side means the column is center-aligned. You can apply span-level formatting to 
the content of each cell using regular Markdown syntax:

| Function name | Description                    |
| -------------:| ------------------------------ |
| `help()`      | Display the help window.       |
| `destroy()`   | Destroy your computer!         |
